# Resources for the Business Analytics Battle

This repository contains resources for 
the *Business Analytics Battle*,
a competition using *Statapults*,
and hosted by *Black and Gold Analytics*, 
the sports analytics club at the University of Central Florida.

Relevant R code will be uploaded soon...

...until then, please download and install R
and RStudio, following the instructions in the
[Resources](https://github.com/JoshuaEubanksUCF/Black_and_Gold_Analytics/tree/main/Resources) folder. 

As mentioned in the instructions, 
install R first, which is the computational engine. 
Only after R is installed, 
install RStudio, which will recognize your instance of R
and the installation process will configure the files. 

Also, install GitHub Desktop, following the instructions 
in the same folder.

With these tools, you will be able to pull code 
and run it on your computer.
