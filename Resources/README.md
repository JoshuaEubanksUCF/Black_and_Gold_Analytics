# Software for Business Analytics

## GitHub

GitHub is an online repository for storing software. It is a safe location where you save successive versions of your code so that past versions of your code can be recovered, should you need to make corrections or replace your computer. It is also useful to collaborate on software because multiple software developers will be able to modify the same online repository.

### Installing Git and GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
for interacting with GitHub, 
the code repository.
Follow this link to download
[https://desktop.github.com/](GitHub Desktop).  

### Opening a GitHub Account

To use GitHub to download software and make contributions
to software projects, you will need to open a GitHub account.
Instructions are available at the following link:


[https://help.github.com/en/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)


(the free, desktop version will be fine).

Now, you will be able to download the programs we will use
in Black and Gold Analytics. Next, you will need to download and install more software to run these programs.


## R and RStudio

R is a popular programming language for statistical analysis. 
RStudio is an Interactive Development Environment (IDE) 
which provides a GUI
for writing and running programs in R. 

To get started, install R first, which is the computational engine. 
Then install RStudio, which will recognize your instance of R
and the installation process will configure the files. 

### Installing R

R is available at the following link:

https://www.r-project.org/

(Again, the free, desktop version will be fine).

As part of the installation, you will have to choose a mirror on which the software is stored. 
Since R is a large-scale collaborative software project, 
many copies of it are stored on many computers throughout the world. 
Choose any location in the United States for a marginally faster download.


### Installing RSudio

Begin this step only after having installed R, 
since RStudio depends on an installation of R 
to run R programs.

RStudio is available at the following link:

https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

(As above, the free, desktop version will be fine).


Once RStudio is installed,  you can set the color-coding of your screen in RStudio to the same that will be used in the demonstrations. This is optional but it is useful when troubleshooting to have matching output. To set the color scheme, click Tools > Global Options... > Appearance and select the Editor theme "Tomorrow Night Bright."

Now, your IDE should be color-coded just like the ones used
by professional computer programmers in real life and in the movies. 


# Tutorials

Once the software is installed, you can get started 
with the following tutorials.
